# AI & ML Internship – Task 1
## Understanding Dataset & Data Types

### About the Task
This task focuses on understanding a dataset before applying machine learning. The goal is to analyze the dataset structure, identify different types of data, check data quality, and determine whether the dataset is suitable for ML.

### Dataset Used
- Titanic Dataset

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

### What I Did
- Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas
- Viewed the dataset structure using head(), tail(), and info()
- Identified numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary columns
- Used describe() to study statistical details
- Identified the target variable for machine learning
- Checked for missing values and data imbalance
- Documented observations in a dataset analysis report

### Target Variable
- Survived

### Files in This Repository
- Jupyter Notebook containing dataset analysis
- Titanic dataset CSV file
- One-page Dataset Analysis Report
- README file

### Learning Outcome
This task helped me understand how to explore a dataset, identify data types, and analyze data quality before building machine learning models.
